## Neural Tangent Kernels (NTKs)

Start with the following:

- [Lilian Weng's Blog on Mathe Behind NTKs](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2022-09-08-ntk/)
- [Understanding the Neural Tangent Kernel](https://www.eigentales.com/NTK/)
- 
- [Neural Tangent Kernel, Applied Probability Notes](https://appliedprobability.blog/2021/03/10/neural-tangent-kernel/)
- [Prior's for Infinite Networks](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4612-0745-0_2)

If you're interested in the functional analysis foundations of NTKs
- [Similarity of Neural Network Models: A Survey of Functional and Representational Measures](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.06329)

Now you should be ready for the NTK foundational papers:
- [Neural Tangent Kernel: Convergence and Generalization in Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07572), NeruiPS 2018
- [Deep Neural Networks as Gaussian Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00165), ICLR 2018
- [On Lazy Training in Differentiable Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.07956)
